/// [MtgCard] objects represent individual Magic: The Gathering
/// cards that players could obtain and add to their collection
/// (with a few minor exceptions).
///
/// Cards are the API’s most complex object. You are encouraged
/// to thoroughly read this document and also the article about
/// layouts and images.
///
/// ### Card Names
///
/// Internally, Scryfall tracks the uniqueness of “Oracle names.”
/// (i.e. names you can pick when an effect asks you to “choose a
/// card name”). Each unique Oracle name is separately available
/// in the card names catalog.
///
/// Note that while most Oracle card names are unique, Scryfall also
/// indexes other objects such as tokens and Unstable set variants
/// which do not always have a unique name.
///
/// ### Multiface Cards
///
/// Magic cards can have multiple faces or multiple cards printed
/// on one card stock. The faces could be shown divided on the
/// front of the card as in
/// [split cards](https://scryfall.com/search?q=is%3Asplit) and
/// [flip cards](https://scryfall.com/search?q=is%3Aflip), or the
/// card can be double-faced as in
/// [transform cards](https://scryfall.com/search?q=is%3Atransform)
/// and [modal DFCs](https://scryfall.com/search?q=is%3Amdfc).
///
/// Scryfall represents multi-face cards as a single object with
/// a card_faces array describing the distinct faces.
